# What can I do with this?
This is a set of bash scripts that will install Arch Linux for you.
# Is it ready?
This tool is undergoing a major rewrite. At the moment the "headless" setup option works. Plasma is a work in progress.
# Usage:
Just run the `install_x86_64.sh` script and follow the script's instructions.
# Why?
If you are installing Arch on lots of computers (like me) it can get pretty annoying and repetitive pretty quickly. This project aims to automate, or at least simplify the process.
